This is a series of exercises that involve implementing operations over natural
numbers.

## How to use

First, make sure you have [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)
installed. The code to implement is in the `lib/` directory. Each function has been
stubbed out with `undefined` and must be replaced with a working definition. You
can check your progress by executing the test suite:

```
$ stack test
```
